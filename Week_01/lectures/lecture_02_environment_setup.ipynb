    "### Python\n",
    "Python is the dominant language in scientific computing due to its readability and vast ecosystem of libraries.\n",

    "### Conda\n",
    "Conda is a package manager and environment management system. It helps you create isolated environments for different projects to avoid dependency conflicts.\n",

    "Jupyter Notebooks (and Jupyter Lab) provide an interactive environment where you can combine code, text, and visualizations.\n",

    "*   `numpy`: Numerical computing.\n",
    "*   `matplotlib`: Plotting.\n",
    "*   `pandas`: Data manipulation.\n",

    "*   **Backup:** Keep a remote copy of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Git Workflow\n",
    "1.  `git status`: Check the state of your working directory.\n",
    "2.  `git add <file>`: Stage changes for commit.\n",
    "3.  `git commit -m \"message\"`: Save changes to the history.\n",
    "4.  `git push`: Upload changes to the remote repository (GitHub).\n",
    "5.  `git pull`: Download changes from the remote repository."

    "1.  **Script Everything:** Avoid manual steps in GUIs.\n",
    "2.  **Document Dependencies:** Always include an `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt`.\n",
    "3.  **Use Relative Paths:** Code should run regardless of where the project folder is located.\n",
