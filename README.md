Week 2 Task 5: With 4D-stem all scan positions have a diffraction pattern generated. So, by utilizing virtual detectors you calculate and visualize what various images would look like with various detectors and detector geometries. Because the 4D-stem contains all the information needed, making a virtual detector is just a matter of establishing the parameters wanted (mainly, detector size and geometry) and integrating the signal that would have been received if the detector were really there during the initial aquistion.
